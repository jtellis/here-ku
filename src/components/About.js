      Here-ku is here for you, wherever here may be...
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we need to stop, take a breath, and collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect experiences, we collect photos, we collect moments and memories. Why not take it a step further by being calculatingly present in the here and now. And what better way than by challenging yourself to be in the moment with the disciplined practice of here-ku! It's fun, rewarding and free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here-ku is a time to reflect, take in your surroundings and put them into words. Your here-ku is only visible to others in your location, and theirs for you to enjoy while you're there, so that you can have shared experiences with those standing in the exact location of where your here-ku was written, even when you are by yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more likes you get, the more likely your haiku makes it to the top! And the more likely you are to be a featured user on here-ku's homepage!
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus of here-ku is not only one of mindfulness, but that of shared consciousness and connection. Use here-ku to beautifully encapsulate a suspended moment in time, providing a sensation of illuminated brevity and balance amidst the busiest of days.
